## Choices Made

- I used shadcn UI components because they provide clean, accessible, and customizable components out of the box, which made building the UI faster and easier.

- I also implemented date formatting for webinar dates to avoid unformatted or inconsistent date displays, which I had faced as a problem in earlier projects.

## Roadblock & Learning

While working on this project, I faced issues with Tailwind CSS not rendering styles properly on the `webinars/page.tsx`. I double-checked my PostCSS configuration and global CSS files multiple times but couldnâ€™t find the cause at first. After several attempts, the issue suddenly resolved itself, likely due to correcting my CSS imports and Tailwind setup.

This taught me the importance of verifying Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) and ensuring the PostCSS config is correct.
